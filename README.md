### Technologies Used

1. Vanilla JS for front-end views
2. Webpack for bundling front-end
3. Axios for making API calls
4. Node / Express back-end
5. Express-ws for utilizing Websockets

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* Make that you have Node.js and npm installed. 
* No database required.

### Installing

Simply clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:GroverW/test-driven-tetris.git
```

Then, from inside the root directory run

```
npm install
```

And you should be good to go!

### Bundling the Frontend with Webpack

From the root directory, run the following command

```
npx webpack --mode="<MODE>"
```

Where mode is your desired build process (e.g. development).

### Starting The Backend

From the root directory, run the following command

```
nodemon --watch src server.js
```

The backend will be automatically restarted on save.

## Running the tests

To run unit-tests - from the root directory, run the following command:
```
jest
```
